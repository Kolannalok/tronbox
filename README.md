# TronBox
TronBox is a smart contract development, testing, and deployment tool for blockchains using the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM). 
TronBox allows you to:
- Use built-in functions for smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management
- Execute external scripts in the TronBox environment
- Communicate directly with contracts using interactive console tools
- Efficiently develop automated contract testing
- Make contract deployment and migration scriptable & extensible
- Deploy contracts to any number of public & private TRE networks with powerful network management capabilities

TronBox is a fork of [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle).

## Quick Usage
### Installation<br>
Before you can use TronBox, install it using the npm command. 详细安装请参考安装说明。
```
$ npm install -g tronbox
```
_Note: To verify the PGP signature, see [here](https://github.com/jz2120100058/tronbox/blob/master/FURTHER_INFO.md#verifying-the-pgp-signature)._

### Create a default Tron-Box Project：
```
$ tronbox init
```
Once this operation is completed, you'll now have a project structure with the following items:

contracts/: Directory for Solidity contracts<br>
migrations/: Directory for scriptable deployment files<br>
test/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts<br>
tronbox.js: TronBox configuration file<br>

### Compile:
If you want to only compile, you can simply run tronbox compile.
```
$ tronbox compile
```

To compile all contracts, use the ```--compile-all``` option.
 
Specify a network using the ```--network``` option. Network name must exist in the configuration.

### Migrate
To deploy our smart contracts, we're going to need to connect to a blockchain. We can use the TronBox Runtime Environment to launch and interact with the blockchain.
```
$ tronbox migrate
```

### Test
To run all tests, you can simply run tronbox test.
```
$ tronbox test
```

### Interact with the contract<br>
To interact with the contract, you can use the tronBox console.
```
$ tronbox console
```
